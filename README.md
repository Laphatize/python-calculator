# python-calculator

This is a super basic terminal-based calculator. If you have python installed on your computer, than this program will work just as fine. If, you don't be sure to install it here: https://www.python.org/downloads/.

The only imported module that's in this project is "time". I used this python module to create stops throughout the program.

I've always been a javascript kinda guy. I've always ignored python. After, using my Rpi as a webserver, I decided to see what else I could do with it. Since, my computer was broken at the time, I was using my Raspberry Pi as my main computer. I had one of those surges of motivation that made me really want to suddenly program. There wasn't a really good editor for me to code in javascript, so I decided to try out python I really liked the language, so I started making programs with python!
